# Gediz-University-Robotics-Workshop

This is a pic project not an Arduino at all.
We used Arduino as a 3.3Volt regulated power supply.
The project is based on pic16f877 and a SD card module.
It needs little high frequency of PIC MCU such as 40MHz,
but we used an extra crystal to increase the speed to 16MHz.
PIC drives the speaker with PWM signals according to the "wav" format
music file which is stored in SD card module. We'll share full work and
details after getting our ordered PIC12 MCU.
Enjoy it!
